        <section>
            <p>Delta Capital is an independent quantitative trading firm focused on the research, development, and operation of systematic investment strategies. We design, test, and deploy models driven by data, disciplined validation, and explicit risk controls.</p>
            <p>We are not discretionary traders, signal vendors, or a retail-facing platform. Our work is research-led and execution-focused.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Delta Capital conducts quantitative research with the goal of identifying repeatable patterns in financial markets and expressing those insights through systematic strategies.</p>
            <p>Our work spans the full lifecycle of quantitative trading:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research and data analysis</li>
                <li>Model development and testing</li>
                <li>Portfolio construction</li>
                <li>Risk management</li>
                <li>Live execution and monitoring</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All strategies are evaluated continuously and modified or retired when assumptions no longer hold.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>Our process is designed to prioritize robustness and risk awareness over complexity.</p>
            <h3>Research & Data</h3>
            <p>We source, clean, and analyze market data to explore hypotheses grounded in statistical and economic reasoning.</p>
            <h3>Model Development</h3>
            <p>Models are constructed using a range of quantitative techniques and are evaluated as components of a broader system, not in isolation.</p>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>Strategies are tested using out-of-sample methods, walk-forward analysis, and stress scenarios to reduce overfitting and false confidence.</p>
            <h3>Portfolio Construction</h3>
            <p>Signals are combined with explicit constraints to balance risk, diversification, and capital efficiency.</p>
            <h3>Risk Management & Execution</h3>
            <p>Exposure limits, monitoring, and execution logic are enforced prior to and during live trading.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Risk Awareness</h2>
            <p>Trading involves risk, including the potential loss of capital. Market conditions change, models degrade, and assumptions fail. Risk management is treated as a core design requirement rather than a secondary consideration.</p>
            <p>We emphasize drawdown awareness, exposure limits, and continuous monitoring across all deployed strategies.</p>
