            <h2>Model Validation</h2>
            <p>Our research process is predicated on a commitment to out-of-sample validation and the prevention of overfitting. Models are subjected to a battery of tests, including walk-forward validation and Monte Carlo stress testing, to ensure their robustness across a wide range of potential market regimes.</p>
             <p>A model is not considered for production unless it demonstrates statistical significance after accounting for transaction costs, execution slippage, and data-mining bias.</p>

            <h2>Ensemble Approach</h2>
            <p>We do not rely on a single monolithic model. Instead, we deploy an ensemble of diverse, uncorrelated predictive models. This approach reduces model-specific risk and creates a more resilient portfolio. Signals are generated from a variety of sources and combined using a proprietary weighting algorithm that considers both the model's historical performance and its recent predictive accuracy.</p>
