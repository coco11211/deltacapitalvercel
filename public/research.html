            <h1>Research Philosophy</h1>
            <p>Our research approach is grounded in skepticism and iteration. Models are treated as provisional tools, not truths, and are evaluated based on how they behave across time, regimes, and market conditions.</p>
            <p>We prioritize robustness, interpretability, and empirical validation over theoretical elegance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Modeling Approach</h1>
            <p>We employ a range of quantitative techniques, including statistical models and machine-learning methods, depending on the problem being addressed.</p>
            <p>No single model or technique is relied upon exclusively. Where appropriate, ensembles and diversified approaches are used to reduce sensitivity to individual assumptions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Validation Discipline</h1>
            <p>Validation is a central part of our research process.</p>
            <p>We emphasize:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Out-of-sample testing</li>
                <li>Walk-forward evaluation</li>
                <li>Stress testing across market regimes</li>
                <li>Sensitivity analysis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Results that do not persist outside the training environment are not deployed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Ongoing Evaluation</h1>
            <p>Research does not stop at deployment. Models are continuously monitored for performance drift, behavioral changes, and regime sensitivity. Strategies may be adjusted, paused, or retired when their behavior diverges from expectations.</p>
