Find two securities that move together. When they diverge, bet on convergence. The strategy is market-neutral by construction — long one stock, short the other. Returns come from the spread, not the market direction. Simple in concept, demanding in execution.</p>

<h2>Finding Cointegrated Pairs</h2>
<p>Correlation measures how two assets move together directionally. Cointegration is different — it means two price series share a long-run equilibrium relationship. Correlated stocks can drift apart permanently. Cointegrated stocks must eventually converge. The distinction matters enormously for pairs trading.</p>
<p>The Engle-Granger test identifies cointegrated pairs. Run a regression of one price series on the other. If the residuals are stationary (mean-reverting), the pair is cointegrated. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on the residuals confirms stationarity. A p-value below 0.05 suggests a tradeable relationship.</p>
<p>Pair selection requires domain knowledge beyond statistics. Companies in the same industry, with similar business models and exposures, make better pairs. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Visa and Mastercard. ExxonMobil and Chevron. Economic reasoning supports the statistical relationship and increases confidence in its persistence.</p>

<h2>Spread Construction and Signal Generation</h2>
<p>The spread is the difference between two normalized price series. Z-score normalization converts the spread into standard deviation units. A z-score of +2 means the spread is two standard deviations above its mean — an extreme divergence suggesting the long stock is overvalued relative to the short.</p>
<p>Entry signals trigger when the z-score exceeds a threshold, typically 1.5 to 2.0 standard deviations. The trade: short the outperformer, long the underperformer. Exit when the z-score returns to zero (the mean) or crosses a small threshold like 0.5. Stop losses trigger at extreme z-scores (3.0+) to limit losses on broken pairs.</p>
<p>Half-life of mean reversion determines position sizing and holding periods. A pair with a 5-day half-life mean-reverts quickly — positions are short-duration and can be sized larger. A pair with a 60-day half-life ties up capital longer and faces more risk of relationship breakdown. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models estimate half-life from historical spread behavior.</p>

<h2>Risk Management in Pairs</h2>
<p>Pairs trading is market-neutral but not risk-free. The primary risk is pair divergence — when the historical relationship breaks permanently. Mergers, acquisitions, regulatory changes, or fundamental shifts can destroy cointegration. A stop loss at 3-4 standard deviations limits catastrophic losses from broken pairs.</p>
<p>Sector concentration is a hidden risk. Running 20 pairs all in the technology sector creates correlated exposure. A sector rotation or regulatory event affects all pairs simultaneously. Diversifying pairs across sectors and geographies reduces this concentration risk.</p>
<p>Leverage amplifies both returns and risks. Pairs trading typically generates small per-trade returns (0.5-2%), so leverage is often necessary for meaningful absolute returns. But leveraged pairs positions in broken relationships can produce rapid, significant losses. Conservative leverage ratios (2-3x) balance return requirements with survival probability.</p>

<h2>Statistical Arbitrage at Scale</h2>
<p>Modern stat arb extends pairs trading to hundreds or thousands of relationships simultaneously. Instead of trading individual pairs, factor-based stat arb constructs portfolios with exposure to mean-reversion across the entire cross-section of stocks. The law of large numbers smooths individual pair risk.</p>
<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposes stock returns into common factors and idiosyncratic components. Stat arb strategies trade the idiosyncratic component — betting that stock-specific deviations from factor-explained returns will revert. This approach is more robust than individual pairs because it diversifies across many names.</p>
<p>Capacity is a real concern. Stat arb strategies trade similar signals and compete for the same mean-reversion opportunities. Crowding reduces profit margins and increases the risk of synchronized unwinds. The August 2007 quant crisis demonstrated how crowded stat arb strategies can produce correlated losses across seemingly independent portfolios.</p>

<h2>Implementation and Technology</h2>
<p>Real-time spread monitoring requires robust infrastructure. Prices must be synchronized — comparing a 10:00 AM print for Stock A with a 10:05 AM print for Stock B introduces noise. Tick-level data and careful timestamp alignment improve signal quality.</p>
<p>Execution quality determines profitability. Spreads of 0.5-2% per trade leave little room for slippage. Simultaneous execution of the long and short legs is critical. If one leg executes immediately and the other is delayed, the realized spread differs from the intended spread. Algorithmic execution that coordinates both legs minimizes implementation shortfall.</p>
<p>Transaction costs must be modeled accurately. Commission, borrowing costs for the short leg, and market impact all reduce realized returns. A strategy that backtests profitably with zero costs often fails with realistic cost assumptions. Conservative cost estimates are essential for honest backtesting.</p>

<h2>Evolving the Strategy</h2>
<p>Machine learning enhances pair selection. Neural networks can identify non-linear relationships that traditional cointegration tests miss. Clustering algorithms group stocks by behavioral similarity rather than industry classification, discovering unexpected pairs with strong mean-reversion properties.</p>
<p>Alternative data improves timing. Sentiment divergences between paired stocks can predict spread movements before prices adjust. Earnings estimate revisions, short interest changes, and options flow data all provide information about future spread direction. Integrating these signals with traditional statistical measures improves strategy performance.</p>
